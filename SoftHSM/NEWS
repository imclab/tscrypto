Known issue:

SoftHSM 1.2.1 - 2011-05-03 

* Backport mutex handling from v2 for increased multithreaded 
  performance.
* Remove signature verification used for debugging purposes.
  (was enabled with ./configure --enable-sigver)
* Added an index to the attribute table in the database.
* Optimization of the database handling.


SoftHSM 1.2.0 - 2010-09-30

* Added mechanism CKM_RSA_X_509 (use Botan 1.9.7 to fix a bug
  when verifying these signatures)
* The softhsm command now have the option --module <path>
  To use a PKCS#11 library other than SoftHSM.
* The softhsm command now import all parts of the RSA key.
  CKA_EXPONENT_1, CKA_EXPONENT_2, and CKA_COEFFICIENT is not needed
  by SoftHSM but might be needed by other HSM:s.
* Ticket #163: softhsm-keyconv now support BIND format v1.3
* Write message to stderr when the config file cannot be found
* CKA_WRAP_WITH_TRUSTED was not handled correctly. But it has not
  been a problem since wrapping is not supported.
* Set CKA_KEY_GEN_MECHANISM to CK_UNAVAILABLE_INFORMATION when
  importing objects.
* C_GetInfo now returns CKR_CRYPTOKI_NOT_INITIALIZED if library
  is not initialized.
* Force clean up if the app does not do C_Finalize (using auto_ptr)
* Limit the scope of the session objects to the owner application
* softhsm --optimize will clean up leftovers (session objects)
  from applications that haven't closed down properly.
* Do not use CKF_HW, the mechanisms are not performed by a device.
* The ulMinKeySize and ulMaxKeySize are not used for the digesting
  mechanisms, but we set them to zero for applications that forget
  this.
* Used wrong buffer size for signatures. This was only a problem
  for keys where (key size % 8 == 1), e.g. 1025 bit keys. 
* C_Login now returns CKR_USER_ANOTHER_ALREADY_LOGGED_IN instead of
  CKR_USER_TOO_MANY_TYPES


SoftHSM 1.1.4 - 2010-04-06

* Respect --disable-64bit
* Respect $DESTDIR for config files
* The binaries can now show the version number

  softhsm.conf

SoftHSM 1.1.0 - 2009-11-02

  It can also convert back to BIND format.
* C_FindObjectsInit is now up to 80 % faster.
* KNOWN BUG: A version of Botan available in some OS has a problem with 
             the entropy. This causes SoftHSM to freeze in some operations.

* Added a check for the Botan library in config script
* SoftHSM will not add a default label/ID to a key pair when the
  key pair is generated, as were the case in the previous
  versions.
* Improved database handling
* New database schema. Is not compliant with previous versions.
* Comments can be added to the config file by using #
* The default location of the config file is $sysconfdir/softhsm.conf
* Simplified the configure options
* The softhsm tool initialize the tokens by using the library.
* Import keys via PKCS#11 and the softhsm tool.
* Export keys via the softhsm tool


SoftHSM 1.0.0-RC1 - 2009-03-10

* Versioning moved to the configure script
* This is release candidate 1


SoftHSM 0.5 - 2009-02-20

* Admin tool for creating tokens.
* Config file in /etc/softhsm.conf
* All session objects are removed when the session creating
  them are closed.
* User credentials as specified in PKCS#11


SoftHSM 0.4 - 2009-02-10

* Only one library is compiled (libsofthsm.so). The log level
  is defined by using the flag --with-loglevel


SoftHSM 0.3 - 2009-02-03

  as atomic functions. The mutex handling is activated when given 
  correct parameters to the init function.
